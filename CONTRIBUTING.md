All patches are welcome. Feel free to even suggest some catch and funny titles for the existing Examples. I really want to make this collection as interesting to read as possible.

If you're adding a new example, please do create an issue to discuss it before submitting a patch.

You can use the following template for adding a new example:

<pre>
### Some fancy Title

```py
# Setting up the code.
# Preparation for the magic...
```

**Output (Python version):**
```py
>>> triggering_statement
Probably unexpected output
```
(Optional): One line describing the unexpected output.

**Note:** All the examples mentioned below are run on Python 3.5.2 interactive interpreter unless explicitly specified.


#### ðŸ’¡ Explanation:
* Brief explanation of what's happening and why is it happening.
  ```py
  Setting up examples for clarification (if necessary)
  ```
  **Outupt:**
  ```py
  >>> trigger # some example that makes it easy to unveil the magic
  # some justified output
  ```
```
</pre>
