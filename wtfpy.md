> A collection of tricky Python examples

Python being an awesomoe higher level language, provides us many functionalities for our comfort. But sometimes, the outcomes may not seem obvious to a normal Python user at the first sight. Here's an attempt to collect such examples and see what exactly is happening under the hood! I find it a nice way to learn internals of a language and I think you'll like them as well!
